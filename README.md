## Requirements
+ Please refer to eg3d installation guidelines: <a href='https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d'>https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d</a>.

+ Download pretrained eg3d models _ffhqrebalanced512-128.pkl_  from <a href='https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d/blob/main/docs/models.md'>https://github.com/NVlabs/eg3d/blob/main/docs/models.md</a>, and put it in _Codes_.

+ Install Mediapipe: <a href='https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe'>https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe</a>.

+ Download pretrained warp-aware encoder models from <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L576COZyXX0Lwz8U71NbJ2Vtp7SZBZY0/view?usp=sharing'>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L576COZyXX0Lwz8U71NbJ2Vtp7SZBZY0/view?usp=sharing</a>, and put it in _Codes_.

## Quick Start
+ We provide a launch script for editing facial images. You can directly run with:
```.bash
bash launch.sh
```

## Editing
+ For one random seed, e.g., 0, you can obtain a facial image with its 3D landmarks.
```.bash
python generate_3D_landmarks.py --seeds 0
```

+ Then, you will obtain a source_3d_ldms.txt and a target_3d_ldms.txt, then you can edit the locations of ldms in target_3d_ldms.txt.

+ You can obtain warped images with:
```.bash
python gen_warped_images.py --outdir=out --network=ffhqrebalanced512-128.pkl
```

+ You can obtain final edited images with:
```.bash
python gen_inversion_warped_images.py --outdir=out --network=ffhqrebalanced512-128.pkl

# --edit_shape controls editing facial shape, and --edit_exp controls editing facial expressions.
# We also provide some editing directions in editing_direction, which can be used by --direction.
```
